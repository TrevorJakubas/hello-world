# hello-world
The journey of a thousands miles begins with a single step. This repository represents mine.
My name is Trevor Jakubas. I graduated from St. Cloud State University in 2015. My hometown of Sauk Centre, MN is famous for being the basis of the book Main Street by St. Claire Lewis. That book represents the only thing of note to ever happen there.
